# Data-Ananlysis-Projects

Welcome to the Data Analysis Projects repository!

This repository contains a collection of data analysis projects I've completed, ranging from exploratory data analysis and visualization to predictive modeling and machine learning. Each project includes detailed documentation and code to help you understand my thought process and methodology.

Some of the techniques and tools utilized in these projects include:

    Data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas and NumPy
    Exploratory data analysis and visualization using matplotlib and seaborn
    Predictive modeling and machine learning using scikit-learn, TensorFlow and Prophet
    
Feel free to explore the projects and provide feedback or suggestions. If you have any questions or would like to collaborate on a project, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for visiting!
